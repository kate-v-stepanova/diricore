I attempted to parallelize these scripts, but H5py does not support parallel writing to the same file. Still, the plotting can be parallelized, but it won't affect the performance much, so I did not continue in this direction. For complete parallelization, I would have to change the scripts to save one H5py file for each sample, and then modify the scripts that plot to read from diferent filees.
